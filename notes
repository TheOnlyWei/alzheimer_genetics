Running webpack causes it to bundle your files according to specifications
  in your webpack.config.js file
  - bundling all your files into one big file is required for better performance
    otherwise you will have to load each file separately, which takes a long time.
  - To get your bundle:
    $webpack
    $node bundle.js
